				<p>Born on January 18, 1973 in Hongqiao District,<br>
				Tianjin City
				Guo Degang, born on January 18, 1973 in Tianjin, China, with ancestral roots in Shanxi Province, China, is a mainland Chinese crosstalk actor, director, screenwriter, singer, actor, host, and founder of Beijing Deyun Society. In 1979, he began to learn art. In 1989, I worked at the Hongqiao Cultural Center. In 1998, the Beijing Cross Talk Conference (predecessor of Deyun Society) was founded. In 2000, we began collaborating with Gan Qian. On June 8, 2004, he became his teacher under Hou Yaowen; In October, the "Happy Teahouse" program of Beijing Literature and Art Broadcasting began broadcasting live recordings of Guo Degang, marking the beginning of media attention to Deyun Society. On November 5, 2005, a special event was held at the China Grand Theater in Tianjin. On April 8, 2006, in the performance of "Guo Degang Deyun Society Tianjin Provincial Cross talk Special Session", he broke his own record of 22 consecutive comebacks with 25 consecutive comebacks.</p>
			
			<p>
				 On May 3, 2008, the performance of <br>
				 "Commemorating the 90th anniversary of the birth of Mr. Hou Baolin" was held in the Great Hall of the People, becoming the first cross talk performer to hold a personal special performance in the Great Hall of the People. On February 9, 2013, he appeared at the CCTV Spring Festival Gala and performed the cross talk show "The Loser". On January 17, 2021, at the Tianjin Spring Festival Gala recording site, I collaborated with Ma Zhiming to perform the Taiping lyrics "Snipes and Clams Struggle" and received a gift from Ma Zhiming personally, which was written as "Heir of the Horse School". In January 2022, I created a small song "Unity as a City" for Tianjin's fight against the epidemic. Guo Degang brought the actors and audience back to the theater in the form of returning to the small theater of cross talk, and with his own efforts, created a thriving situation in cross talk. Many of his cross talk performances after 2005 were deeply influenced by the new tradition established by Guo Degang.
